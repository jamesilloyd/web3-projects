First Smart Contract using the web3.university tutorial.

1. Deployed simple hello world smart contract with constuctor and update function to Alchemy
2. Created a script to interact with the smart contract using hardhat 
3. Deployed smart contact to etherscan and interacted with it by connecting to MetaMask

The second part of the project included making a dApp that could
1. Connect a Metamask wallet to my dApp project
2. Read data from my smart contract using the Alchemy Web3 API
3. Sign Ethereum transactions using Metamask
